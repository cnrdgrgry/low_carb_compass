# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Low_carb_compass

### Personal project for an online health and wellbeing resource.

After following a lower carbohydrate eating plan (often referred to as the keto diet) for several years, I successfully lost 40 kg, improved my fitness, and even cycled 300 km in 22 hours. This experience led me to firmly believe in the benefits of reducing carbs for both physical and mental health.

However, this past year I fell off the wagon, and the weight crept back on—18 kg to be exact. But I’m now fully back into a ketogenic metabolic state and eager to share the benefits of this lifestyle.

Increasing research highlights how a lower carbohydrate approach can help reduce, and even reverse, insulin resistance and diabetic effects. It may also support better psychiatric health and, potentially, reduce cancer risks, particularly if you follow the Metabolic Dysfunction Hypothesis for Cancer. But here’s the thing—terms like “keto,” “diet,” and “paleo” often put people off. I understand that.

I prefer to think of it not as a restrictive diet but rather as an evolutionary-appropriate way of eating. After all, we didn’t eat pizza, pastries, and cola back in the caves. In fact, humans are pretty much the only mammals that don’t regularly enter a ketogenic state due to our love affair with processed, carbohydrate-heavy foods—things like cereals, starchy vegetables, and sugar.

Our ancestors ate what they could hunt and gather — wild animals, eggs, roaming herds of beasts, berries, nuts, uncultivated roots, and the occasional leaf. Homo sapiens have been around for approximately 300,000 years, but we’ve only been cultivating grain for around 10,000 to 12,000 years. Refined sugar only became widely affordable during the Industrial Revolution, and ultra-processed foods are a product of the past century. Our bodies haven’t had time to evolve to cope with these modern foods.

That’s what I believe, anyway. But I know not everyone agrees with this perspective, and that's totally okay. We're all on our own journeys when it comes to health, and I'm here to share what has worked for me and may work for others.

This isn’t a resource to tell people what they should eat. Instead, it’s a space for those who are curious to explore how a potentially evolutionary-appropriate diet might enhance their overall well-being. It’s about experimenting and discovering what works for you. Nourish the root cause, and let modern medicine treat the symptoms.
